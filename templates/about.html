                                The RDF (Resource Description Framework) community is in desperate need of a simpler way to create vocabularies and ontologies. Building a vocabulary requires many skills and lots of attention to detail. Even for a group of experts, this can become a daunting task, and many of the efforts can be wasteful if not consulted with a larger community of people. This is why we created <a href="http://www.vocabs.org">www.vocabs.org</a>. It allows  vocabularies to be created and validated by the community, through a simple web-based voting system. Similar to how Wikipedia has built the encyclopedia of crowdsourced content, Vocabs is trying to be a repository of community-driven vocabularies. You can initiate a discussion about a vocabulary you may want to build. Other members of the community will then see it and comment it. They can also further improve it with their own terminology. Finally, based on the total amount of votes each term has received, the system will automatically compile an RDF-friendly format of the entire conversation, allowing it to be consumed by popular semantic reasoners.
                                </p>
                                <h4>How it works</h4>
                                <p>
                                This site uses powerful community-driven voting-based approaches, such as the ones used on StackOverflow or Hacker News, to allow you to discuss about an ontology and write triple definitions directly in the comments you're making.
                                </p>
                                <p>
You can comment using N-Triples syntax (Turtle to be supported), so anybody can extend a specific vocabulary. Then based on the amount of votes a specific comment receives, it will be more valuable, and it will automatically find its place in the final vocabulary: for example say 2 comments define the same "hasColor" property, only one has "10 points" and the other has only "2 points". The system will automatically do the filtering, and only the highest scored comments will find their place in the final vocabulary.
                                </p>
                                <p>
So in essence this is very similar to opening your text editor, and writing some Turtle syntax down. The cool part is that it happens online, so other people can immediately comment and validate what you wrote.
                                
                                </p>
                                <h4>Building your first vocabulary</h4>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Click on <a href="{{>conf_path}}submit">submit</a> on the navigation bar at the top. (be sure you're logged in)</li>
                                    <li>Fill in the basic information, such as the vocabulary ID and its title.</li>
                                    <li>Now you can leave a comment and define your vocabulary terms in the comment itself. Here's an example of a vocabulary that is trying to describe Wine: <a href="http://www.vocabs.org/term/WineOntology">http://www.vocabs.org/term/WineOntology</a></li>
                                    <li>You can also insert <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-Triples">N-Triples</a> syntax directly in your comment. This way you can formally describe your ontology using triples. We will soon support <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_(syntax)">Turtle</a> as well.</li>
                                    <li>When many different people have made their contributions to the vocabulary, you can click on the "download" link at the top of the vocabulary page, to export the entire vocabulary in N-Triples format.</li>
                                    <li>Each of the properties/classes you've defined in the vocabulary (as comments), will also have their own URI. For example, in the WineOntology example above, the community has defined the class Wine with an URI of: <a href="http://www.vocabs.org/term/WineOntology#Wine">http://www.vocabs.org/term/WineOntology#Wine</a></li> (it's important to note that the URIs are automatically referenceable and link directly to the propert term inside the vocabulary)
                                </ul>
